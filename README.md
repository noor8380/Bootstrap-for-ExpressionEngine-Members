#Bootstrap Theme for EE Members
This project is a basic skin for ExpressionEngine's Members module that uses Bootstrap classes. Don't waste precious manhours trying to start from scratch or dealing with EE's default templates - Swap in these files with Bootstrap and knock out like 80% of the UI work in one fell swoop!

They're intentionally bare-bones so you can work in your own customizations. It should be compatible with *most* Bootstrap themes from the get-go, though I've only tested it with the default and [Bootswatch's Cosmo theme](http://bootswatch.com/cosmo/).

I guess it goes without saying that this will not work without Bootstrap. You can grab the latest version at [getbootstrap.com](http://getbootstrap.com).
